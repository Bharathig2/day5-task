3.difference between window, screen and document in javascript 
Window
       Each browser tab has its own top-level window object. Each iframe and deprecated frame element has its own window object too, nested within a parent window. Each of these windows gets its own separate global object.window. Window always refers to window,  but window.parent  and window.top might refer to enclosing windows, giving access to other execution contexts. In addition to document and screen described below, window properties include 
•	setTimeout() and setInterval() binding event  handlers to a timer
•	location giving the current URL
•	history with methods back() and forward() giving the tab’s mutable history
•	navigator describing the browser software
Document
            Each window object has a document object to be rendered. These objects get confused in part because HTML elements are added to the global object when assigned a unique id.
the paragraph element can be referenced by any of the following:
•	document.getElementById("id")
•	document.querySelector("#id")
•	document.body.firstChild
•	document.body.children[0]
Screen
           The window object also has a screen object with properties describing the physical display:

•	screen properties width and height are the full screen
•	screen properties availWidth and availHeight omit the toolbar
